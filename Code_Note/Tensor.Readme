-building computational graph
-running computational graph

Computational Graph
: a series of Tensforflow Operations into a graph of nodes

Node
: takes >=0 tensors as inputs and produces 1 tensor output
-> node3 = tf.add(node_a, node_b)

Constant Node
: takes 0 input and output 1 tensor
-> c_node = tf.constant(4.0)

TensorBoard
: display a picture of the computational graph
